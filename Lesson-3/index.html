            Red pandas are small mammals with long, fluffy tails and red and
            white markings. Though they share a name with the more famous giant
            panda, they are not closely related. In fact, the name 'panda' was
            first applied to these animals, and not to the larger
            black-and-white bear. According to the San Diego Zoo, Frédéric
            Cuvier, a French zoologist, first described the red panda in 1825,
            about 48 years before the giant panda was cataloged. He called it
            the most beautiful animal he had ever seen and named it Ailurus
            fulgens, meaning fire-colored, or shining, cat. The common name,
            panda, may be derived from a Nepalese name for these animals,
            nigalya ponya, which may have meant 'bamboo footed.' The giant panda
            was given its name later because of similarities to the red panda.

            15.2 oz).<br />

            #9 Cats can be lethal hunters and very sneaky, when they walk their
            back paws step almost exactly in the same place as the front paws
            did beforehand, this keeps noise to a minimum and limits visible
            tracks.<br />
